# Guidelines for Reviewers

We are aware of the value of a thorough peer review when authors decide to submit their work. On every journal, we try to create and maintain peer review integrity. Making sure reviewers have the tools they need to complete their work properly and efficiently is an essential component of this.

The peer review process for our journals may bein one of the following forms:

- **Single-anonymous review** (also called ‘single-blind peer review’). The reviewer’s name isn’t disclosed to the author.

- **Double-anonymous review** (also called ‘double-blind peer review’). The identity of the reviewers and the authors aren’t disclosed.

## Reasons to consider peer reviewing

1. Get an early view of the exciting new research happening in your field.

2. Gain insight into how to improve your own writing in terms of  writing style, presentation, or the clarity of explanations.

3. Build new connections for future collaborations through networking.

 

## Our philosophy on peer review

In the past, authors have been dissatisfied with how long it takes to publish an article. We makes a sincere effort to handle documents as quickly, fairly, and comprehensively as possible. Peer reviewers are requested to submit their feedback within 10-20 business days as a result.

Most papers are subject to double-anonymous peer review before being accepted for publication. The best technique to obtain frank reviews of manuscripts, in our opinion, is to use anonymous peer reviewers. Peer reviewers are forbidden from getting in touch with authors directly. Before agreeing to review a manuscript and throughout the peer review process, you should take into account the COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers.

An outline of the manuscript lifecycle, from submission to publication, can be viewed here.

## COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers

Peer review rules offer fundamental norms and expectations to which all reviewers should conform while evaluating research publications. Peer reviewers are an integral and crucial element of the peer-review process, but all too frequently they enter the position without any training or knowledge of their ethical responsibilities. These recommendations are meant to be used in all academic fields. The purpose of the COPE Guidelines, which are a formal COPE guideline, is to provide editors and publishers with guidance on required publication ethics behavior.

- Peer reviewers are crucial in maintaining the accuracy of the academic record.

- The academic community's trust and willingness to participate in the peer review process are crucial, and everyone participating must act properly and ethically.

- Reviewers have a responsibility to conduct reviews in an ethical and accountable manner, and journals have a responsibility to provide transparent policies for peer review.

- Clear communication between the journal and the reviewers is essential to facilitate consistent, fair and timely review. 

- For the purposes of these rules, peer review refers to evaluations of manuscript submissions to journals, but it can also refer to evaluations for other platforms and apply to pre- or post-publication public commentary.

- The method will vary depending on the source material and the type of review required, but reviews of other items like preprints, grants, books, conference proceeding submissions, registered reports (preregistered protocols), or data will have a similar underlying ethical foundation.

- Elements of the procedure will also be influenced by the peer review paradigm.
