The publisher also endorses the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) [Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/).

When a manuscript is submitted to our journals, it is assumed that all authors have read, approved of, and adhered to the publication's regulations.  Detailed versions of these regulations are available on their respective websites. 

## Ethics and consent

The Declaration of Helsinki has to be followed, and an appropriate ethics committee must have given its approval, before any research involving human subjects, human materials, or human data is conducted. All manuscripts reporting such research must contain a statement outlining this, including the name of the ethical committee and the reference number when applicable. The paper should also state if a study has been granted an exemption from needing ethics approval (including the name of the ethics committee that granted the exemption). The Editor should be given access to further material and supporting documentation upon request. If the editor feels that the research has not been conducted in a proper ethical framework, the manuscript may be rejected.

## **Retrospective ethics approval**

Retrospective ethics permission is frequently impossible to get once a study has already started, and it may not even be possible to evaluate the article for peer review. In these situations, it is up to the Editor to decide whether to move forward with peer review.

## **New clinical tools and procedures**

Authors who describe the use of a novel technique or tool in a clinical setting, such as in a case study or technical advance, must clearly explain in the manuscript why the novel technique or tool was thought to be more suitable than standard clinical practice to address the patient's clinical need. If the new procedure has already been given clinical approval at the authors' institution, this rationale is not necessary. For any experimental use of a novel process or technology where a clear clinical advantage based on a clinical need was not immediately apparent prior to treatment, authors would be expected to have secured ethics committee permission and informed patient consent. Please ensure that you adhere to the above guidelines if applicable.

## **Consent to participate**

Informed consent to participate in the study must be acquired from participants in all research involving human subjects (or, in the case of individuals under the age of 16, from their parent or legal guardian), and a statement to this effect must be included in the publication. At the editor's discretion, manuscripts describing studies involving vulnerable groups (such as unconscious patients), situations where coercion may have been possible (such as in prison), or where consent may not have been given voluntarily may be given consideration and possibly referred to an internal editorial oversight group for additional review. All types of personally identifiable information, including biological, clinical, and biometric data, require consent. Articles discussing human transplantation experiments must provide a disclaimer that no prisoners' organs or tissues were used, as well as the institution(s), clinic(s), or department(s) from where the organs or tissues were received. If required, written confirmation of consent must be provided.
