When preparing figures, please follow the formatting instructions below.

- The order in which the figures are posted should correspond to the order in which they are numbered in the text. Multi-panel figures (those with parts a, b, c, d, etc.) must be provided as one composite file containing all of the figure's components.
- Figures should be uploaded in the correct orientation.
- Figure titles (max 15 words) and legends (max 300 words) should be provided in the main manuscript, not in the graphic file.
- Figure keys should be incorporated into the graphic, not into the legend of the figure.
- To reduce the quantity of white space around the graphic, each figure should be carefully cropped. When the accepted content is ready for publication on our website, cropping figures increases accuracy when using the figure in conjunction with other elements.
- Individual figure files should not exceed 10 MB. If a suitable format is chosen, this file size is adequate for extremely high quality figures.
- **Please be aware that if a figure (or table) has already been published somewhere else, the author(s) must ask the copyright holder for permission before using it.** If authors want to incorporate photos that have already been published in non-open access publications, they must obtain the rights holder's consent in order for all figures to be open access. The figure legend should note any permission received, and the reference list should include the original source.

Your work will have the best chance of being understood and fairly evaluated by editors and reviewers if it is presented in a well-structured document and in English that is easy to read. Many researchers discover that having some impartial assistance enables them to best present their findings.
