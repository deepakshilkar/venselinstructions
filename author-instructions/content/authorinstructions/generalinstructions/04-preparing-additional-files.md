As the length and quantity of data is not restricted for many article types, authors can provide datasets, tables, movies, or other information as additional files.

All additional files will be posted along with the accepted article. Do not attach files such as patient consent forms, language change certificates, or revised versions of the master script document with changes detected. Such files should be emailed to the journal's editorial email address upon request, quoting the manuscript reference number. Do not submit completed patient consent forms unless requested.

Results that would otherwise be marked as "data not shown" must be attached as additional files. Because many web links and URLs break quickly, we require supporting data to be attached as additional files or placed in an approved repository. Please do not link to data on any personal/departmental website. Do not enter individual participant data. The maximum file size for each additional file is 20MB and files are scanned for viruses upon delivery. Each supplementary file must be cited sequentially in the main text.

If additional material is provided, please list the following information in a separate section of the manuscript text:

- File name (e.g. Additional file 1)
- File format including the correct file extension for example .pdf, .xls, .txt, .pptx (including name and a URL of an appropriate viewer if format is unusual)
- Title of data
- Description of data

Additional files should be named "Additional file 1" and so on and should be referenced explicitly by file name within the body of the article, e.g. 'An additional movie file shows this in more detail [see Additional file 1]'.
