# Templates
The manuscript must be submitted as a Word document or a LaTeX file with all necessary details. We have provided templates for both file types on the author instructions page. Please note that PDF is not accepted. Please also note that manuscripts not adhering to these basic instructions will be returned to authors, since it makes it difficult for the peer reviewers as well as editors to process them. To avoid delay in processing, please consider following the guidelines.
