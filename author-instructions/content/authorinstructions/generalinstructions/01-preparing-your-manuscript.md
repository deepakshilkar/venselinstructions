This section provides general style and formatting information only. Formatting guidelines for specific article types used across the journal can be found below. 

**In case the word counts and other limits differ, these will be mentioned on specific instruction pages.**

Manuscripts submitted for initial consideration must adhere to the following considerations:

- Submissions must be complete with clearly identified standard sections used to report original research, free of annotations or highlights, and include all numbered and labeled components.
- Figures, charts, tables, schemes, and equations should be embedded in the text at the point of relevance. Separate graphics can be supplied later at revision, if necessary. These will be requested if the manuscript is further considered for acceptance. 
- When required by a journal's structure or length limitations, manuscript templates should be used.
- References can be provided in any style, but they must be complete, including titles. For information about the required components of different reference types, please refer to the [ACS Style Quick Guide](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsguide.40303).
- Supporting Information must be submitted as a separate file(s).



# ORCiD identifier

Our systems and publication workflows support the ORCiD iD  which is an ID that uniquely attaches your identity to your research work, such as your articles and datasets. 

### 

### Why use ORCiD

- Many researchers share the same name, while others’ names change throughout their career. With an ORCiD iD, you can persistently associate your name with your research works.
- If you already have an ORCiD iD, our submission system will automatically fill in your profile.
- The ORCiD iD icon will appear next to your name in the article. Clicking on the icon will take readers to your profile on ORCID.org and allow them to discover your further publications.
- Crossref Auto-Update keeps your ORCiD record up-to-date.
