# Editorial Process:

Upon acceptance of manuscripts, the journal publishes an uncorrected proof on the website until our in-house team formats and readies the article for final display. Authors can opt out of this feature if they only wish to see the final display.

Research articles should report on original primary research. Reviews provide comprehensive and authoritative coverage of a topic area. 

#### Research Communications

The guidelines applicable for each of these categories are outlined below. Submitting an article preformatted in the journal style makes the in house process easier and allows for faster in house processing time. 

{{% alert theme="info" %}} The authors have a choice of opting for language editing for a small extra fee.{{% /alert %}}

The language editing package does not provide feedback on the scientific content and its integrity. The authors are responsible for the content they publish. The basic editing package includes:

- Language editing for grammatical correctness, natural English tone, and accurate terminology by an editor from your field

- Free formatting for journal

# Submission checklist:

Submission guidelines have been provided in the following sections. Given below is a checklist for each article type. You may use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before you send it to us for review.

Please be aware that we have article templates available in Microsoft Word and LaTeX format. We also have templates for Endnote and Mendeley to help you format your citations. Please refer to the links below.

**Template**: MS Word | LaTeX

**Style**: {{< button href="https://app.box.com/s/3lr0rwdinxrhzv6odpvifiijwl7qv93i" >}} Download EndNote Style {{< /button >}}

### Research article

**Title page**

The title page must contain the following:

- A title

- Author names

- Corresponding author details (indicated using an asterisk [*], and an email address of the corresponding author).

- Keywords (up to 6; these help reders discover your content easily).

 

### Main body

Abstract: (250 words, unstructured, discussing the background/purpose, method, results and discussion). 

1. **Introduction**

2. **Methods**

3. **Results**

4. **Discussion**

5. **References**

All the figures and tables must be placed within the main body of the manuscript in an appropriate location. The authors must ensure that all figure and table citations in the text match the files provided.

Supplementary data must be uploaded separately at the time of submission. In case of analytical data, the journal might request system files from the authors if these are requested by the reviewers. Authors must keep these handy with them. All the abbreviations must be compiled in a list and should be provided in a section outlined in the manuscript template.

**Additional information:**

The additional information will have to be placed int he template in the appropriate section. If you are providing your manuscript without formatting, please place these sections after the conclusion but before the 

***Competing interests***

The authors must declare any conflicts of interest. Guidelines pertaining to this are provided in detail here

***Funding***

Acknowledge any funding received to conduct the research. Use the below format as standard:

“This research was funded by [Funding agency] under the Grant No [provide grant number if available] on a project titled [name the project].

***Authors' contributions***

List out contributions of each author in preparing the manuscript. Please refer to CRediT guidelines for more information. CRediT - Contributor Roles Taxonomy.

***Acknowledgements***

Acknowledge everyone who helped conduct this research, such as technical assistants, etc.

***Authors' information (optional)***

Provide an author biography in 75 to 100 words describing author’s education, current work, and interest areas.

### Cover letter

The cover letter should be used to briefly describe the authors and declare any conflicts of interests. The cover letter must also justify why the authors deem the content must be added the the existing scientific literature.

### Research review

All the above guidelines apply to a review process. However, authors have the liberty to not use the IMRaD format and instead use their independent way of structuring.

For research reviews, the authors must describe their literature search strategy in a subheading titled “Search strategy”. The authors must also aim to provide a strong conclusion with their opinion on the topic of discussion.

#### Authorship criteria

Authorship credits researchers for their contributions to a study and thereby also involves accountability. Please use the following points when deciding authorship.

Authorship is given to an individual, if:

- An individual made substantive contributions to research

- Data acquisition

- Analysis

- Interpretation

- Participated in the compilation of manuscript draft

Contributors not meeting the above criteria for authorship should be listed in the Acknowledgements section. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring transparency and reproducibility of data, assuring that the research was conducted using best practices in the field, and that all the authors have unanimously agreed to manuscript submission.

 

#### References

The journal follows a modified version of Vancouver style. We have provided templates for Endnote, Mendeley, and Zotero. Please avoid citing unpublished data (from your own work or any other work you know of). The authors may also choose to format the articles manually, in which case, the styles are given below.

### Double blinding policy

This journal uses double-blind review for all its manuscripts to , which means that both the reviewer and author identities are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process.  To facilitate this, authors need to ensure that their manuscripts are prepared in a way that does not give away their identity.  All allusions to author’s identities must be avoided int he main body of the manuscript.

Use the third person to refer to work the Authors have previously undertaken, e.g. replace any phrases like “as we have shown before” with “… has been shown before [Anonymous, 2007]” .

All identifying information elsewhere i.e., Funding, Acknowledgments, and Conflicts of interests, is removed during the editorial review.

 

### Plagiarism check

The Editor will select an article if it is original, unpublished, plagiarism-free (checked using iThenticate). The authors must aim to keep the similarity below 10%. In exceptional cases such as when standard protocols are described, a similarity up to 15% may be accepted conditionally. The authors may opt for a plagiarism check service for a small one time fee. This will allow authors to reflect on their content. We check plagiarism using iThenticate. In exceptional cases where large improvements are needed, out in house team offers feedback on how plagiarism can be minimized.
